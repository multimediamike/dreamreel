* Dreamreel GUI
- main thread only accepts key events and then passes them through to the
GUI manager module
- GUI manager module is not a thread; it has a function that is called by
the video output module that paints any UI elements over the current frame
before the frame is sent to the renderer
- GUI module needs to have a mutex to prevent the module from updating GUI
elements at the same time they are being sent to the TA
- GUI module has these public functions:
  update_elements(): called by the main task to update the status of
    the controller buttons; returns when all necessary UI element states
    have been updated; locks mutex on the way in, unlocks on the way out
  draw_elements(): called by the video output to paint necessary UI
    elements; assumes that the TA is already set up to receive the correct
    plane of data; locks mutex on the way in, unlocks on the way out
- problem: update_elements() can cause reads of the filesystem which could
take a little while but will block the video in the meantime; instead, 
when it is time to read, ask the main module to read data and callback 
when it is finished
- the above may not be a problem if a ISO9660 fs is always cached
- alternatively, take the initiative to read the disc when it is inserted
