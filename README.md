# Dreamreel

Dreemreel is an unfinished media player project developed circa 2003. It was designed to run on the Sega Dreamcast video game console while leveraging code from the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and [xine](https://www.xine-project.org/home) projects.

For more information about the project, code, and design philosophy, read this post-mortem blog post: [Writing a Dreamcast Media Player](https://multimedia.cx/eggs/writing-a-dreamcast-media-player/).
